"Data Source:"
"-SEER Incidence Data, November 2024 Submission (1975-2022), SEER 8 registries [https://seer.cancer.gov/registries/terms.html]."
"Methodology:"
"-Rates are per 100,000 and are age-adjusted to the 2000 US Std Population (20 age groups - Census P25-1130)."
"-The Annual Percent Change (APC) and Average Annual Percent Change (AAPC) estimates were calculated from the underlying rates using the Joinpoint Trend Analysis Software [https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint], Version 5.4, April 2025, National Cancer Institute using the default settings."
"-The APC's/AAPC's direction is 'Rising' when the entire 95% confidence interval (C.I.) is above 0, 'Falling' when the entire 95% C.I. is lower than 0, otherwise, the trend is considered 'Not Significant'."
"-The 2020 incidence rate(s) were not used in the fit of the trend line(s) and are displayed on the graph as gray data points. Impact of COVID on SEER Cancer Incidence 2020 data [https://seer.cancer.gov/data/covid-impact.html]"
"Race/Ethnicity Coding:"
"-For years prior to 1990, the Census Bureau has only provided county-level population estimates for White, Black, and Other races."
"Cancer Site Coding:"
"-See SEER*Explorer Cancer Site Definitions [https://seer.cancer.gov/statistics-network/explorer/cancer-sites.html] for details about the cancer site coding used for SEER Incidence data."
